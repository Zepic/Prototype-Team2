## Note

1. A skeleton made based on the [Bootstrap 4.5][3] framework (I think that we need to consult with **Terje**).
1. Thanks to Bootstrap we will be using the same class in css, we will have a great grid system and we will have access to jQuery. Just read the documentation (link above).
1. If there is time, we can then write our own skeleton without using Bootstrap.
1. This solution will save us a lot of time to play with the appearance and we will be able to focus on the main functions of the program.
1. Fake data has been moved to a separate file.
1. All functions have been done "rigidly" and need to be rewritten.
1. I guess we don't need ID in the notes because each note has its unique index in the array.
